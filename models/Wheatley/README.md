> Next-generation scheduling problem solver based on GNNs and Reinforcement Learning

- Wheatley first intended to replicate [L2D](/models/L2D/README.md), a model proposed in this paper:
    [Learning to Dispatch for Job Shop Scheduling via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12367)
- Uses some intuitions and ideas from [A Reinforcement Learning Environment For Job-Shop Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03760)
