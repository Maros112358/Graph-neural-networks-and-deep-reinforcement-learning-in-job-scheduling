## Models

### [Wheatley](models/Wheatley/)

- trained 15x15 Wheatley model, showcase for small benchmark instances -> [SHOWCASE](models/Wheatley/repo/Showcase.ipynb), dynamic version not working properly

### [fjsp-drl](models/fjsp-drl/)

- model runs for all available benchmarks -> [SHOWCASE](models/fjsp-drl/repo/Showcase%20fjsp-drl.ipynb), no dynamic version

### [L2D](models/L2D/)

- model runs for all available benchmarks -> [SHOWCASE](models/L2D/Showcase.ipynb), dynamic version 

### [IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP](models/IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP/)

- I trained 3 models running on all available benchmarks -> [SHOWCASE](models/IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP/repo/ieee_icce_rl_jsp.ipynb), working dynamic model

### [End-to-end-DRL-for-FJSP](models/End-to-end-DRL-for-FJSP/)

- model runs for all available benchmarks -> [SHOWCASE](models/End-to-end-DRL-for-FJSP/repo/FJSP_RealWorld/Showcase.ipynb), no dynamic version
