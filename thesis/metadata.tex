\def\AbstractEN{%
The priority dispatching rule (PDR) is a greedy heuristic algorithm used to obtain approximate solutions to the NP-hard job scheduling problem (JSP). The manual design of hand-crafted PDRs requires domain knowledge to achieve good results. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been used to automate the process of designing priority dispatching rules, where PDRs are formulated as a Markov Decision  Process exploiting graph representation of JSP, and a graph neural network (GNN) selects the operations to be dispatched. In this thesis, we present the overview of five models published in literature with their source code publicly available on GitHub and experimentally compare their performance on three different variants of JSP. Our experiments show that the choice of input features, e.g., the amount of remaining work, significantly affects the model's performance regardless of the GNN architecture. This suggests that the feature selection is essential for learning high-quality PDRs.
