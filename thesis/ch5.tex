\chapter{Discussion}

In this chapter, we discuss and interpret our findings from the previous chapter.

\section{JSSP} \label{discussion_jssp}
As can be seen from Table 4.1 and Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 in \ref{results_jssp}, the best performance was achieved by the model \textbf{IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP}, followed by the model \textbf{fjsp-drl} and the priority dispatching rule \textbf{MWKR}. We would like to point out that the results of \textbf{MWKR} performance we obtained are much better than those reported by the authors of \textbf{L2D} in their paper \cite{zhang2020learning}. However, we did not find their implementation of \textbf{MWKR} in their GitHub repository \cite{github_l2d}, so we could not investigate the cause of this difference.
\par
Good performance of \textbf{MWKR} hints at the importance of the sum of processing times of remaining operations as an operation feature. The models \textbf{L2D} and \textbf{End-to-end-DRL-for-FJSP} did not include this feature. We also did not select this as a feature for \textbf{Wheatley}. Since \textbf{Wheatley} has easily customizable operation features, an idea for further research would be to add this operation feature to \textbf{Wheatley}. On the other hand, the model \textbf{IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP} used the number of remaining operations in the current job as a feature, as discussed in \ref{model_iee_icce_rl_jsp}. The model \textbf{fjsp-drl} also included the number of unscheduled operations in the job as a feature, as discussed in \ref{model_fjsp_drl}. This also suggests the importance of the remaining work as a feature.

\section{FJSP}
As can be seen from Table 4.6 in \ref{results_fjsp}, the best results were obtained by model \textbf{End-to-end-DRL-for-FJSP}. Tables 4.6 and Figures 4.7 show that the machine selection PDR \textbf{SPT} improves the makespan significantly. This hints at the importance of the processing time as a feature in the model. The model \textbf{End-to-end-DRL-for-FJSP} includes processing time as a feature explicitly in the machine embeddings. The model \textbf{fjsp-drl} doesn't include processing time as a machine feature. On the other hand, it includes the time when the machine will finish all its currently assigned operations as a feature, as discussed in \ref{model_fjsp_drl}, which is similar to the machine selection PDR \textbf{EET}. This may explain why the model \textbf{fjsp-drl} yielded worse results.

\section{DJSP}
For the load factor 1, \textbf{L2D} yielded the best results, as can be seen in Table 4.9. For the load factor 2, \textbf{IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP} and \textbf{L2D} produced similar makespans. \textbf{L2D} worked better for larger instances. For the load factor 4, \textbf{IEEE-ICCE-RL-JSP} yielded the best results. 
\par
Worse results yielded by \textbf{Wheatley} for all load factors can be a consequence of the poor performance in solving static JSSP.
\par
A lower load factor equates to a greater time between the arrival of two consecutive jobs. In \textbf{L2D}, the initial node features include boolean $I(o)$ representing if operation $o \in O$ has already been scheduled and the lower bound of the estimated time of completion $C_{LB}(o)$. The result of this experiment can be interpreted that for more sparsely arriving jobs, $C_{LB}(o)$ is a more important feature. As the load factor increases, a DJSP is more similar to a static JSSP, and other features, which are more important for a JSSP, e.g., the sum of processing times of remaining operations discussed in \ref{discussion_jssp}, become more critical.
