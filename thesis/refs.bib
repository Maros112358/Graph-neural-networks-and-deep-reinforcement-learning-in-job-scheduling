The complexity and relevance of the FJSP have led to numerous research works on its modeling and resolution. This paper reviews some of the research of the past 30 years on the problem, by presenting and classifying the different criteria, constraints, configurations and solution approaches that have been considered. Recent emerging topics on complex shop scheduling, multi-criteria optimization and uncertain and dynamic environments are discussed. Finally, future research opportunities are proposed.}

In this paper, a new time and memory efficient representation of the disjunctive graph is proposed. It has the form of a graph matrix and combines advantages of a few classical graph representations, enabling easy operating on the problem data. Computational experiments have proved higher efficiency of the proposed approach over the classical ones.}

  abstract = {Job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is one of the well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) that aims to optimize the sequential assignment of finite machines to a set of jobs while adhering to specified problem constraints. Conventional solution approaches which include heuristic dispatching rules and evolutionary algorithms has been largely in use to solve JSSPs. Recently, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for delivering better solution quality for JSSPs. In this research, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheduling model for solving the standard JSSP. Our DRL model uses attention-based encoder of Transformer network to embed the JSSP environment represented as a disjunctive graph. We introduced Gate mechanism to modulate the flow of learnt features by preventing noise features from propagating across the network to enrich the representations of nodes of the disjunctive graph. In addition, we designed a novel Gate-based graph pooling mechanism that preferentially constructs the graph embedding. A simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based action selection network is used for sequentially generating optimal schedules. The model is trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm which is built on actor critic (AC) framework. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing heuristics and state of the art DRL based baselines on generated instances and well-known public test benchmarks. © 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Gantt is recognized as their developer their origins and provenance are less well known. Gantt was a close associate of Frederick W. Taylor and an advocate of Scientific Management. His paper describing the use of “graphics” for general production planning appeared alongside Taylor’s Shop Management in 1903 and was an integral and critical component of Taylor’s system. Without Gantt’s charts to plan the workloads for men and machines both in departments and throughout the factory Taylor’s system would have been unworkable. The focus of this paper is to describe more fully their development and early history; and review their contemporary uses and future prospects.}
