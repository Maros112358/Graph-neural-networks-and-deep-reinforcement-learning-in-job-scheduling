  abstract = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, which has wide applications in the real world. The complexity and relevance of the FJSP have led to numerous research works on its modeling and resolution. This paper reviews some of the research of the past 30 years on the problem, by presenting and classifying the different criteria, constraints, configurations and solution approaches that have been considered. Recent emerging topics on complex shop scheduling, multi-criteria optimization and uncertain and dynamic environments are discussed. Finally, future research opportunities are proposed.}

It discusses the concept of dynamic job shop scheduling, dynamic events, evaluation indicator, dynamic scheduling strategy, dynamic scheduling methods, and scheduling system. The scheduling methods are divided into two classes: the precise methods and approximate methods. Characteristics of each method are analyzed. At last, problems which need further investigation and possible research directions are pointed out.}

abstract = {The disjunctive graph is one of the most popular models used for describing instances of the job shop scheduling problem, which has been very intensively explored. In this paper, a new time and memory efficient representation of the disjunctive graph is proposed. It has the form of a graph matrix and combines advantages of a few classical graph representations, enabling easy operating on the problem data. Computational experiments have proved higher efficiency of the proposed approach over the classical ones.}
