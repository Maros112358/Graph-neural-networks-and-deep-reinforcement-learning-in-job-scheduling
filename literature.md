### [Learning to Dispatch for Job Shop Scheduling via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12367.pdf)

- official implementation: [L2D](models/L2D/)
- formulates dispatching as Markov Decision Process with reward minimizing the makespan
- the agent is designed as Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), which is a recent GNN variant

### [Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Graph Neural Network and Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9826438)

- official implementation: [fjsp-drl](models/fjsp-drl/)
- works with Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) which is a more general case than JSSP
- formulates dispatching as Markov Decision Process with reward minimizing the makespan
- the formulation of FJSP ased on a novel heterogeneous graph representation of scheduling states
- the agent uses a heterogeneous-graph-neural-network (HGNN)
